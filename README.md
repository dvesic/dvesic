ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dvesic, Dejan VesiÄ‡

Based in Belgrade, Serbia, in IT for as long as I remember (let's say that my first computer was [Commodore 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128) :-) )

Interested in applying technology in right way - to free your time, ease daily task and above all, to do that in most non-intrusive way, ideally completely seamless.

Apart from that, working as IT manager / Senior manager in large software company.
